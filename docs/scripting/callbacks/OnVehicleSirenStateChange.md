```c
public OnVehicleSirenStateChange(playerid, vehicleid, newstate)
{
    if (newstate)
    {
        GameTextForPlayer(playerid, "~W~Siren ~G~on", 1000, 3);
    }
    else
    {
        GameTextForPlayer(playerid, "~W~Siren ~r~off", 1000, 3);
    }
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

This callback is only called when a vehicle's siren is toggled on or off, NOT when the alternate siren is in use (holding horn).
