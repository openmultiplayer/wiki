## Description

This callback is called when a player gives damage to an actor.

| Name            | Description                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| playerid        | The ID of the player that gave damage.                |
| damaged_actorid | The ID of the actor that received damage.             |
| amount          | The amount of health/armour damaged_actorid has lost. |
| weaponid        | The reason that caused the damage.                    |
| bodypart        | The body part that was hit                            |

## Returns

1 - Callback will not be called in other filterscripts.

0 - Allows this callback to be called in other filterscripts.

It is always called first in filterscripts so returning 1 there blocks other filterscripts from seeing it.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerGiveDamageActor(playerid, damaged_actorid, Float: amount, weaponid, bodypart)
{
    new string[128], attacker[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];
    new weaponname[24];
    GetPlayerName(playerid, attacker, sizeof (attacker));
    GetWeaponName(weaponid, weaponname, sizeof (weaponname));

    format(string, sizeof(string), "%s has made %.0f damage to actor id %d, weapon: %s", attacker, amount, damaged_actorid, weaponname);
    SendClientMessageToAll(0xFFFFFFFF, string);
    return 1;
}
```
