## Description

Called when a player sends a chat message.

| Name     | Description                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| playerid | The ID of the player who typed the text. |
| text[]   | The text the player typed.               |

## Returns

It is always called first in filterscripts so returning 0 there blocks other scripts from seeing it.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerText(playerid, text[])
{
    new pText[144];
    format(pText, sizeof (pText), "(%d) %s", playerid, text);
    SendPlayerMessageToAll(playerid, pText);
    return 0; // ignore the default text and send the custom one
}
```
