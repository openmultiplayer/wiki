Spectate Modes to be used with [PlayerSpectatePlayer](../functions/PlayerSpectatePlayer.md) and [PlayerSpectateVehicle](../functions/PlayerSpectateVehicle.md) functions.

| Type | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| SPECTATE_MODE_NORMAL | Normal spectate mode (third person point of view). Camera can not be changed. |
| SPECTATE_MODE_FIXED | Use SetPlayerCameraPos after this to position the player's camera, and it will track the player/vehicle set with PlayerSpectatePlayer/PlayerSpectateVehicle |
| SPECTATE_MODE_SIDE | The camera will be attached to the side of the player/vehicle (like when you're in first-person camera on a bike and you do a wheelie). |
