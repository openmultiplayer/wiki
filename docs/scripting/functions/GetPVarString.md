## Description

Gets a player variable as a string.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| playerid | The ID of the player whose player variable to get. |
| varname | The name of the player variable, set by SetPVarString. |
| &string_return | The array in which to store the string value in, passed by reference. |
| len | The maximum length of the returned string. |

## Returns

The length of the string.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerConnect(playerid,reason)
{
    new playerName[MAX_PLAYER_NAME+1];
    GetPlayerName(playerid, playerName, MAX_PLAYER_NAME);
    SetPVarString(playerid, "PlayerName", playerName);
    return 1;
}

public OnPlayerDeath(playerid, killerid, reason)
{
    new playerName[MAX_PLAYER_NAME+1];
    GetPVarString(playerid, "PlayerName", playerName, sizeof(playerName));

    printf("%s died.", playerName);
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

If length of string is zero (value not set), string_return text will not be updated or set to anything and will remain with old data, neccesying that you clear the variable to blank value if GetPVarString returns 0 if that behavior is undesired
