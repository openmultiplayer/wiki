PlayerTextDrawLetterSize(playerid, MyTextDraw, 3.2 ,5.1);
```

## Notes

:::tip

When using this function purely for the benefit of affecting the textdraw box, multiply 'Y' by 0.135 to convert to TextDrawTextSize-like measurements

:::

:::tip

Fonts appear to look the best with an X to Y ratio of 1 to 4 (e.g. if x is 0.5 then y should be 2).
