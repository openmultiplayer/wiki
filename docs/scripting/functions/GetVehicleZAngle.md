## Description

Get the rotation of a vehicle on the Z axis (yaw).

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| vehicleid | The ID of the vehicle to get the Z angle of. |
| &Float:z_angle | A float variable in which to store the Z rotation, passed by reference. |

## Returns

1: The function was executed successfully.

0: The function failed to execute. This means the vehicle does not exist.

The vehicle's rotation is stored in the specified variable.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
     if(strcmp(cmdtext, "/vehrot", true) == 0)
     {
          new currentveh;
          new Float:z_rot;
          new message[40];

          currentveh = GetPlayerVehicleID(playerid);

          GetVehicleZAngle(currentveh, z_rot);

          format(message, sizeof(message), "The current vehicle rotation is: %.0f", z_rot);

          SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFFFFFF, message);

          return 1;
     }

     return 0;
}
```
