## Description

Removes a standard San Andreas model for a single player within a specified range.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| playerid | The ID of the player to remove the objects for. |
| modelid | The model to remove. |
| Float:fX | The X coordinate around which the objects will be removed. |
| Float:fY | The Y coordinate around which the objects will be removed. |
| Float:fZ | The Z coordinate around which the objects will be removed. |
| Float:fRadius | The radius around the specified point to remove objects with the specified model. |

## Returns

This function does not return any specific values.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
    // When the player connects, objects with model 615 will be removed within a
    // range of 200.0 from the point 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, which is the center of San Andreas.
    RemoveBuildingForPlayer(playerid, 615, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 200.0);
    return 1;
}
public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
    // When the player connects, all map objects will be removed.
    RemoveBuildingForPlayer(playerid, -1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 6000.0);
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

In SA-MP 0.3.7 you can use -1 for the modelid to remove all objects within the specified radius.

:::

:::warning

There appears to be a limit of around 1000 lines/objects. There is no workaround. When removing the same object for a player, they will crash. Commonly, players crash when reconnecting to the server because the server removes buildings on OnPlayerConnect.
