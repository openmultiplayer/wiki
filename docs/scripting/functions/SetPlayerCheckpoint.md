## Returns

1: The function executed successfully.

0: The function failed to execute. This means the player specified does not exist.

## Examples

```c
// In this example the player's checkpoint will be set when they spawn.
// On entering the checkpoint they will receive $1000 and the checkpoint will be disabled.

new bool: gOnCheck[MAX_PLAYERS];

public OnPlayerSpawn(playerid)
{
    SetPlayerCheckpoint(playerid, 1982.6150, -220.6680, -0.2432, 3.0);
    gOnCheck[playerid] = true;
    return 1;
}

public OnPlayerEnterCheckpoint(playerid)
{
    if (gOnCheck[playerid]) // if it's true
    {
        GivePlayerMoney(playerid, 1000);
        DisablePlayerCheckpoint(playerid);
        gOnCheck[playerid] = false;
    }
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

Checkpoints are asynchronous, meaning only one can be shown at a time. To 'stream' checkpoints (only show them when players are close enough), use a checkpoint streamer.
