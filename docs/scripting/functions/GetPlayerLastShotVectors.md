```c
public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    if(strcmp(cmdtext, "/lastshot", true) == 0)
    {
        new lsString[128],
            Float:fOriginX, Float:fOriginY, Float:fOriginZ,
            Float:fHitPosX, Float:fHitPosY, Float:fHitPosZ;

        GetPlayerLastShotVectors(playerid, fOriginX, fOriginY, fOriginZ, fHitPosX, fHitPosY, fHitPosZ);
        format(lsString, 128, "Last Shot Information: Origin: %f, %f, %f. Hit position: %f, %f, %f", fOriginX, fOriginY, fOriginZ, fHitPosX, fHitPosY, fHitPosZ);
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, lsString);
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

This function will only work when lag compensation is enabled. If the player hit nothing, the hit positions will be 0. This means you can't currently calculate how far a bullet travels through open air.
