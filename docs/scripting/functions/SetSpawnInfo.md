## Description

This function can be used to change the spawn information of a specific player. It allows you to automatically set someone's spawn weapons, their team, skin and spawn position, normally used in case of minigames or automatic-spawn systems. This function is more crash-safe then using SetPlayerSkin in OnPlayerSpawn and/or OnPlayerRequestClass, even though this has been fixed in 0.2.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| playerid | The PlayerID of who you want to set the spawn information. |
| team | The Team-ID of the chosen player. |
| skin | The skin which the player will spawn with. |
| Float:X | The X-coordinate of the player's spawn position. |
| Float:Y | The Y-coordinate of the player's spawn position. |
| Float:Z | The Z-coordinate of the player's spawn position. |
| Float:rotation | The direction in which the player needs to be facing after spawning. |
| weapon1 | The first spawn-weapon for the player. |
| weapon1_ammo | The amount of ammunition for the primary spawnweapon. |
| weapon2 | The second spawn-weapon for the player. |
| weapon2_ammo | The amount of ammunition for the second spawnweapon. |
| weapon3 | The third spawn-weapon for the player. |
| weapon3_ammo | The amount of ammunition for the third spawnweapon. |

## Returns

This function does not return any specific values.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerRequestClass(playerid, classid)
{
    // This simple example demonstrates how to spawn every player automatically with
    // CJ's skin, which is number 0. The player will spawn in Las Venturas, with
    // 36 Sawnoff-Shotgun rounds and 150 Tec9 rounds.
    SetSpawnInfo( playerid, 0, 0, 1958.33, 1343.12, 15.36, 269.15, 26, 36, 28, 150, 0, 0 );
}
```
