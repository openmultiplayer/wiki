// ...
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    // Create a connection to the database
    if((db_handle = db_open("example.db")) == DB:0)
    {
        // Error
        print("Failed to open a connection to \"example.db\".");
        SendRconCommand("exit");
    }
    else
    {
        // Success
        print("Successfully created a connection to \"example.db\".");
    }
    // ...
    return 1;
}

public OnGameModeExit()
{
    // Close the connection to the database
    db_close(db_handle);
    // ...
    return 1;
