This function does not return any specific values.

## Examples

public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    if (!strcmp(cmdtext, "/storm", true))
    {
        SetPlayerWeather(playerid, 8);

## Notes

:::tip

If TogglePlayerClock is enabled, weather will slowly change over time, instead of changing instantly. There are only valid 21 weather IDs in the game (0 - 20), however the game does not have any form of range check.
