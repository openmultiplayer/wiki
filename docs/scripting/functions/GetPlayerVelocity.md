| playerid | The player to get the speed from. |
| &Float:x | A float variable in which to store the velocity on the X axis, passed by reference. |
| &Float:y | A float variable in which to store the velocity on the Y axis, passed by reference. |
| &Float:z | A float variable in which to store the velocity on the Z axis, passed by reference. |

## Returns

The function itself doesn't return a specific value. The X, Y and Z velocities are stored in the specified variables.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    if (!strcmp("/velocity", cmdtext))
    {
        new Float:Velocity[3], string[80];
    GetPlayerVelocity(playerid, Velocity[0], Velocity[1], Velocity[2]);
        format(string, sizeof(string), "You are going at a velocity of X: %f, Y: %f, Z: %f", Velocity[0], Velocity[1], Velocity[2]);
        SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFFFFFF, string);
    return 1;
    }
}
