| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dest[]                | An array into which the bytes from source are copied in.                              |
| const source[]        | The source array.                                                                     |
| index                 | The start index in bytes in the destination array where the data should be copied to. |
| numbytes              | The number of bytes (not cells) to copy.                                              |
| maxlength=sizeof dest | The maximum number of cells that fit in the destination buffer.                       |

## Returns

True on success, false on failure.

## Examples

```c
//Concatenate two strings with memcpy
new
	destination[64] = "This is ",
	source[] = "a string in a 32 Bit Array";

memcpy(destination, source, strlen(destination) * 4, sizeof source * 4, sizeof destination);
print(destination);
//Output: This is a string in a 32 Bit Array
```
