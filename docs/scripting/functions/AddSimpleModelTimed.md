## Examples

```c
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    AddSimpleModelTimed(-1, 19379, -2000, "wallzzz.dff", "wallzzz.txd", 9, 18); // This wall only renders from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm

## Notes

:::tip

useartwork must be enabled first in server settings in order for this to work When virtualworld is set, the models will be downloaded once the player enters the specific world

:::warning

There are currently no restrictions on when you can call this function, but be aware that if you do not call them inside OnFilterScriptInit/OnGameModeInit, you run the risk that some players, who are already on the server, may not have downloaded the models.
