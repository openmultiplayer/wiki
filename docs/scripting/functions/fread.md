| handle | The handle of the file to read from (returned by fopen).       |
| string | A string array to store the read text in, passed by reference. |
| size   | The number of bytes to read.                                   |
| pack   | Should the string be packed? True/false.                       |

## Returns

The length of string (the read text) as an integer.

## Examples

```c
// Open "file.txt" in "read only" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_read),

    // Initialize "buf"
    buf[128];

// Check, if the file is opened
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Read the whole file
    while(fread(handle, buf)) print(buf);

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("The file \"file.txt\" does not exists, or can't be opened.");
}
// Open "file.txt" in "read and write" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt"),

    // Initialize "buf"
    buf[128];

// Check, if file is open
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Read the whole file
    while(fread(handle, buf)) print(buf);

    // Set the file pointer to the first byte
    fseek(handle, _, seek_begin);

    // Write "I just wrote here!" into this file
    fwrite(handle, "I just wrote here!");

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("The file \"file.txt\" does not exists, or can't be opened.");
}
```
