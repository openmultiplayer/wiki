new str[128];
format(str, sizeof(str), "There are %i slots on this server!", GetMaxPlayers());

## Notes

:::warning

This function can not be used in place of MAX_PLAYERS. It can not be used at compile time (e.g. for array sizes). MAX_PLAYERS should always be re-defined to what the 'maxplayers' var will be, or higher. See MAX_PLAYERS for more info.
