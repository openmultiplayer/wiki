| Name          | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| playerid      | The ID of the player the object is associated to.                                                                                                |
| objectid      | The ID of the object to replace the texture of                                                                                                   |
| materialindex | The material index on the object to change (0 to 15)                                                                                             |
| modelid       | The modelid on which replacement texture is located. Use 0 for alpha. Use -1 to change the material color without altering the existing texture. |

            myObject;

        GetPlayerPos(playerid, X, Y, Z);
        myObject = CreatePlayerObject(playerid, 19371, X, Y, Z+0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 300.0);
        SetPlayerObjectMaterial(playerid, myObject, 0, 19341, "egg_texts", "easter_egg01", 0xFFFFFFFF);
