## Returns

1 - success

0 - failure (invalid vehicle ID).

## Examples

```c
new engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective;
GetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective);
//This would cause all the variable above, to become the status of its subject.
```

## Notes

:::tip

If a parameter is unset (SetVehicleParamsEx not used beforehand) the value will be -1 ('unset').
