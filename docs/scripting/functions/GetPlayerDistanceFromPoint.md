public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/vend", true) == 0)
    {
        new
            Float: fDistance = GetPlayerDistanceFromPoint(playerid, 237.9, 115.6, 1010.2),
            szMessage[44];

        format(szMessage, sizeof(szMessage), "You're %0.2f meters away from the vending machine.", fDistance);
        SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xA9C4E4FF, szMessage);
