```c
public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
    new
        string[24];
    GetPlayerVersion(playerid, string, sizeof(string));
    format(string, sizeof(string), "Your version of SA-MP: %s", string);
    SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFFFFFF, string);

    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

A client's version can be up to 24 characters long, otherwise the connection will be rejected due to "Invalid client connection". However, normal players can only join with a version length between 5 (0.3.7) and 9 (0.3.DL-R1) characters.

:::

:::warning

The string the version gets stored in will be empty if playerid is an NPC.
