| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| playerid | The ID of the player to get the IP address of.                       |
| ip[]     | The string to store the player's IP address in, passed by reference. |
| len      | The maximum length of the IP address (recommended 16).               |

## Returns

The player's IP address is stored in the specified array.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
    new plrIP[16];
    GetPlayerIp(playerid, plrIP, sizeof(plrIP));
    if (!strcmp(plrIP, "127.0.0.1"))
    {
        SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFFFFFF, "Welcome to your server, master :)");
    }
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

PAWN is case-sensitive. GetPlayerIP will not work. This function does not work when used in OnPlayerDisconnect because the player is already disconnected. It will return an invalid IP (255.255.255.255). Save players' IPs under OnPlayerConnect if they need to be used under OnPlayerDisconnect.
