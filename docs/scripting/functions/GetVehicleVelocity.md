    if (!strcmp("/GetMyCarVelocity", cmdtext) && IsPlayerInAnyVehicle(playerid))
    {
        new Float:Velocity[3], output[80];
        GetVehicleVelocity(GetPlayerVehicleID(playerid), Velocity[0], Velocity[1], Velocity[2]);
        format(output, sizeof(output), "You are going at a velocity of X%f, Y%f, Z%f", Velocity[0], Velocity[1], Velocity[2]);
        SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFFFFFF, output);
