| length   | Assigned size of the string, should use sizeof() |

## Return Values

You must add 'native gpci(playerid, serial[], len);' at the top of your script before using any GPCI functions

```c
#if !defined gpci
    native gpci(playerid, serial[], len);
#endif

new szSerial[41]; // 40 + \0

gpci(iPlayerID, szSerial, sizeof(szSerial));
return szSerial;

ReturnGPCI(iPlayerID)
{
    new
