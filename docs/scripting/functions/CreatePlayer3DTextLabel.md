```c
if (strcmp(cmd, "/playerlabel", true) == 0)
{
    new
        PlayerText3D: playerTextId,
        Float: X, Float: Y, Float: Z;

    GetPlayerPos(playerid, X, Y, Z);
    playerTextId = CreatePlayer3DTextLabel(playerid, "Hello\nI'm at your position", 0x008080FF, X, Y, Z, 40.0);
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes
