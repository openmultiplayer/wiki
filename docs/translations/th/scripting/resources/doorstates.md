## Which bit stores what?

The damage of each door (note that the hood and the trunk are also doors) will be saved in 1 byte (which is 8 bits). You can only change the state of one bit for every door at each time - so you have to call the function twice if you want to damage and open the door.

- The **first bit** stores whether the door is **opened (bit 1)** or **not (bit 0)** (the door will still lock (and change the first bit to 0) if closed - its just open).
- The **second bit** stores whether the door is **damaged (bit 1)** or **not (bit 0)** (If you want a damaged door to turn normal you have to remove and re-attach it undamaged).
- The **third bit** stores whether the door is **removed (bit 1)** or **attached (bit 0)**.
- The rest of the bits are empty.

It seems like there is no bit which stores if the door will lock or not.

Notice that you count the bits from behind - so the first is the rightmost bit

## Which byte stores what?

- The **first byte** stores the state of the **hood**.
- The **second byte** stores the state of the **trunk**.
- The **third byte** stores the state of the **drivers door**.
- The **fourth byte** stores the state of the **co-drivers door**.

The states of the 2 rear doors cannot be handled by [GetVehicleDamageStatus](../functions/GetVehicleDamageStatus "GetVehicleDamageStatus") and [UpdateVehicleDamageStatus](../functions/UpdateVehicleDamageStatus "UpdateVehicleDamageStatus").

Notice that I count the bytes from behind - so the first is the rightmost byte

## Example

The following code tells that the hood is removed, the front left door damaged, the front right door opened and the trunk is damaged and opened:

`00000001 00000010 00000011 00000100`

However SA-MP returns a decimal number so you have to convert it to a binary number first to get a result like above. What SA-MP would return you in this case is this:

`16909060`

## Wrapper

Usefull little snippet to avoid working with the bits and bytes too much;

```c
enum Door
{
	DOOR\_HOOD,
	DOOR\_TRUNK,
	DOOR\_DRIVER
	DOOR\_PASSENGER
}

enum DoorState(<<= 1)
{
	IS\_OPENED = 1,
	IS\_DAMAGED,
	IS\_REMOVED
}
 
stock GetDoorState(doorStates, Door:door, DoorState:doorState)
	return (doorStates >>> (8 \* door)) & doorState;
```

## Example usage

```c
new panels, doors, lights, tires;
GetVehicleDamageStatus(vehicleid, panels, doors, lights, tires);
 
 
// simple
if (GetDoorState(doors, DOOR\_DRIVER, IS\_DAMAGED))
{
    [SendClientMessage](./functions/SendClientMessage)(playerid, \-1, "The driver door of your vehicle is damaged!");
}
 
// or even combined
if (GetDoorState(doors, DOOR\_HOOD, IS\_OPENED | IS\_DAMAGED))
{
    [SendClientMessage](./functions/SendClientMessage)(playerid, \-1, "The hood of your vehicle is both opened and damaged!");
}
```
