public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    // If "cmdtext" equals "/EchoWoetJoinList"
    if (!strcmp(cmdtext, "/EchoWoetJoinList", true, 17))
    {
        // Declare "db_result" and "info"
        new DBResult:db_result, info[2][30];

        // Select the join list of the player "Woet"
        db_result = db_query(db_handle, "SELECT * FROM `join_log` WHERE `name`='Woet'");

        // Do these
        do
        {
            // Store the data of "ip" into "info[0]"
            db_get_field_assoc(db_result, "ip", info[0], sizeof info[]);

            // Store the data of "time" into "info[1]"
            db_get_field_assoc(db_result, "time", info[1], sizeof info[]);

            // Print into the console
            printf("Print join list: Name: Woet IP: %s Date: %s", info[0], info[1]);
        }
