```c
public OnPlayerConnect( playerid )
{
    // This example demonstrates how to create a dollar-icon on top of a 24/7 located
    // in Las Venturas. This way new players know where to go with their money!

## บันทึก

:::tip

If you use an invalid marker type, it will create ID 1 (White Square). If you use an icon ID that is already in use, it will replace the current map icon using that ID.

:::

:::warning

You can only have 100 map icons! Marker type 1 (), 2 (), 4 (), and 56 () will cause your game to crash if you have map legends enabled while viewing the map.
