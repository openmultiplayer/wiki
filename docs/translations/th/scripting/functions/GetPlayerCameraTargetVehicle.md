## บันทึก

:::tip

This function can (obviously) only return one vehicle ID at a time, while the player may be looking at multiple. It generally seems to detect the closest vehicle first.

:::warning

This function is disabled by default to save bandwidth. Use EnablePlayerCameraTarget to enable it for each player.
