## ตัวอย่าง

```c
// Add an [AFK] tag to the start of players' names
new playerName[MAX_PLAYER_NAME+1];
GetPlayerName(playerid, playerName, MAX_PLAYER_NAME);
strins(playerName, "[AFK]", 0);
SetPlayerName(playerid, playerName);

// WARNING: Players with names that are 20+ characters long can not have an [AFK] tag, as that would make their name 25 characters long and the limit is 24.
