if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/repair", true) == 0)
{
    new Float:health;
    new veh = GetPlayerVehicleID(playerid);
    GetVehicleHealth(veh, health);
    if (health > 500)
    {
        return SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_RED, "Vehicle doesn't need repairing!");
    }
    SetVehicleHealth(veh, 1000);
    SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_GREEN, "Vehicle repaired!");

Full vehicle health is 1000, however higher values are possible and increase the health of the vehicle. For more information on health values, see here.

A vehicle catches on fire when its health is below 250. It will explode a few seconds later.
