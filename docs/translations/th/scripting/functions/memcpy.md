| numbytes              | The number of bytes (not cells) to copy.                                              |

## ตัวอย่าง

```c
//Concatenate two strings with memcpy
new destination[64] = "This is ";
new source[] = "a string in a 32 Bit Array";
memcpy(destination, source, strlen(destination) * 4, sizeof source * 4, sizeof destination);
print(destination);
//Output: This is a string in a 32 Bit Array
```
