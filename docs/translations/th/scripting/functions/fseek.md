## คำอธิบาย

Change the current position in the file. You can either seek forward or backward through the file.

| Name         | Description                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| handle       | The file handle to use. Returned by fopen.                                                                            |
| position     | The new position in the file, relative to the parameter whence (see below).                                           |
| whence       | The starting position to which parameter position relates.                                                            |
| seek_start   | Set the file position relative to the start of the file (the position parameter must be positive).                    |
| seek_current | Set the file position relative to the current file position: the position parameter is added to the current position. |
| seek_end     | Set the file position relative to the end of the file (parameter position must be zero or negative).                  |

## ส่งคืน

The new position; relative to the start of the file.

## ตัวอย่าง

```c
// Open "file.txt" in "read only" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_read);

// If "file.txt" is open
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Jump to the 1st byte of "file.txt", and print its position
    printf("Begin of file position: %d", fseek(handle, 0, seek_start));

    // Jump to the last byte of "file.txt", and print its position
    printf("End of file position: %d", fseek(handle, 0, seek_end));

    // Jump to the same byte of "file.txt", and print its position
    printf("Currrent file position: %d", fseek(handle, 0, seek_current));

    // Close "file.txt"
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("Failed to open \"file.txt\".");
}
```
