:::warning

This function was added in SA-MP 0.3b and will not work in earlier versions!

:::info

This function is in _world_ space not _local_ space. If you want to make local space angular velocity adjustments, you must apply a rotation matrix based on the [vehicle rotation quat](GetVehicleRotationQuat).
