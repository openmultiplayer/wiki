```c
// Open "file.txt" in "read only" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_read),

    // Initialize "buf"
    buf[128];

// Check, if the file is opened
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Read the whole file
    while(fread(handle, buf)) print(buf);

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("The file \"file.txt\" does not exists, or can't be opened.");
}
// Open "file.txt" in "write only" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_write);

// Check, if file is open
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Write "I just wrote here!" into this file
    fwrite(handle, "I just wrote here!");

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("Failed to open file \"file.txt\".");
}
// Open "file.txt" in "read and write" mode

// Check, if file is open
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Read the whole file
    while(fread(handle, buf)) print(buf);

    // Set the file pointer to the first byte
    fseek(handle, _, seek_begin);

    // Write "I just wrote here!" into this file
    fwrite(handle, "I just wrote here!");

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else

    print("The file \"file.txt\" does not exists, or can't be opened.");
}
// Open "file.txt" in "append only" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_append);

// Check, if file is open
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Append "This is a text.\r\n"
    fwrite(handle, "This is a test.\r\n");

io_read      Reads from the file.
io_write     Write in the file, or create the file if it does not exist. Erases all existing contents.
io_readwrite Reads the file or creates it if it doesn't already exist.
io_append    Appends (adds) to file, write-only. If the file does not exist, it is created.

:::warning

If you use io_read and the file doesn't exist, it will return a NULL reference. Using invalid references on file functions will crash your server!
