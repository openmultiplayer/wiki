:::warning

Known Bug(s): Doesn't work for CARMODTYPE_STEREO. Both front bull bars and front bumper components are saved in the CARMODTYPE_FRONT_BUMPER slot. If a vehicle has both of them installed, this function will only return the one which was installed last. Both rear bull bars and rear bumper components are saved in the CARMODTYPE_REAR_BUMPER slot. If a vehicle has both of them installed, this function will only return the one which was installed last. Both left side skirt and right side skirt are saved in the CARMODTYPE_SIDESKIRT slot. If a vehicle has both of them installed, this function will only return the one which was installed last.
