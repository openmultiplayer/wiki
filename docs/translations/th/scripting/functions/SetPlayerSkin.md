1: The function executed successfully.

0: The function failed to execute. This means the player specified does not exist.

Note that 'success' is reported even when skin ID is invalid (not 0-311, or 74), but the skin will be set to ID 0 (CJ).

## ตัวอย่าง

```c
public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/fireman", true) == 0)
    {
        // Set the player's skin to ID 277, which is a fireman.
        SetPlayerSkin(playerid, 277);
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
stock SetPlayerSkinFix(playerid, skinid)
{
    new
        Float:tmpPos[4],
        vehicleid = GetPlayerVehicleID(playerid),
        seatid = GetPlayerVehicleSeat(playerid);
    GetPlayerPos(playerid, tmpPos[0], tmpPos[1], tmpPos[2]);
    GetPlayerFacingAngle(playerid, tmpPos[3]);
    if (skinid < 0 || skinid > 299) return 0;
    if (GetPlayerSpecialAction(playerid) == SPECIAL_ACTION_DUCK)
    {
        SetPlayerPos(playerid, tmpPos[0], tmpPos[1], tmpPos[2]);
        SetPlayerFacingAngle(playerid, tmpPos[3]);
        TogglePlayerControllable(playerid, 1); // preventing any freeze - optional
        return SetPlayerSkin(playerid, skinid);
    }
    else if (IsPlayerInAnyVehicle(playerid))
    {
        new
            tmp;
        RemovePlayerFromVehicle(playerid);
        SetPlayerPos(playerid, tmpPos[0], tmpPos[1], tmpPos[2]);
        SetPlayerFacingAngle(playerid, tmpPos[3]);
        TogglePlayerControllable(playerid, 1); // preventing any freeze - important - because of doing animations of exiting vehicle
        tmp = SetPlayerSkin(playerid, skinid);
        PutPlayerInVehicle(playerid, vehicleid, (seatid == 128) ? 0 : seatid);
        return tmp;
    }
    else
    {
        return SetPlayerSkin(playerid, skinid);
    }
}

## บันทึก

:::warning

Known Bug(s): If a player's skin is set when they are crouching, in a vehicle, or performing certain animations, they will become frozen or otherwise glitched. This can be fixed by using TogglePlayerControllable. Players can be detected as being crouched through GetPlayerSpecialAction (SPECIAL_ACTION_DUCK). Other players around the player may crash if he is in a vehicle or if he is entering/leaving a vehicle. Setting a player's skin when he is dead may crash players around him. Breaks sitting on bikes.
