new engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective;
GetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective);
SetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, VEHICLE_PARAMS_ON, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective); // ONLY the engine param was changed to VEHICLE_PARAMS_ON (1)
new Timer_VehAlarm[MAX_VEHICLES];

SetVehicleParamsEx_Fixed(vehicleid, &engine, &lights, &alarm, &doors, &bonnet, &boot, &objective)
{
    SetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective);
    if (alarm)
    {
        KillTimer(Timer_VehAlarm[vehicleid]);
        Timer_VehAlarm[vehicleid] = SetTimerEx("DisableVehicleAlarm", 20000, false, "d", vehicleid);
    }
}

forward DisableVehicleAlarm(vehicleid);
public DisableVehicleAlarm(vehicleid)
{
    new engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective;
    GetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective);
    if (alarm == VEHICLE_PARAMS_ON)

## บันทึก

:::tip

The alarm will not reset when finished, you'll need to reset it by yourself with this function. Lights also operate during the day (Only when ManualVehicleEngineAndLights is enabled).
