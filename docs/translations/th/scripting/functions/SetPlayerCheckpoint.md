public OnPlayerSpawn(playerid)
{
    SetPlayerCheckpoint(playerid, 1982.6150, -220.6680, -0.2432, 3.0);
    onCheck[playerid] = true;
    return 1;
}

public OnPlayerEnterCheckpoint(playerid)
{
    if (onCheck[playerid]) // if it's true
    {
        GivePlayerMoney(playerid, 1000);
        DisablePlayerCheckpoint(playerid);
        onCheck[playerid] = false;
    }

## บันทึก

:::warning

Checkpoints are asynchronous, meaning only one can be shown at a time. To 'stream' checkpoints (only show them when players are close enough), use a checkpoint streamer.
