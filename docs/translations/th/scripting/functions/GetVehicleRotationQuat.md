0: The function failed to execute. This means the vehicle specified does not exist.

The vehicle's rotation is stored in the specified variables.

## บันทึก

:::tip

There is no 'set' variation of this function; you can not SET a vehicle's rotation (apart from the Z angle) This function may return incorrect values for unoccupied vehicles. The reason is that the third row of the vehicle's internal rotation matrix gets corrupted if it gets updated while unoccupied.
