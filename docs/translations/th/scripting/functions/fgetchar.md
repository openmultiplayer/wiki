## คำอธิบาย

Reads a single character from a file.

| Name   | Description                                                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| handle | The file handle to use; returned by fopen.                       |
| value  | This parameter has no use, just keep it "0".                     |
| utf8   | If true, read a character as UTF-8, otherwise as extended ASCII. |

## ส่งคืน

If succeed, it returns the extended ASCII or UTF-8 value of the character at the current position in the file, otherwise EOF (end of file).

## ตัวอย่าง

```c
// Open "file.txt" in "read only" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_read),

    // Declare "g_char"
    g_char;

// Check, if "file.txt" is open
if (handle)
{
    // Read all characters, while ignoring UTF-8.
    while((g_char = fgetchar(handle, 0, false)) != EOF)
    {
        // Print the character
        printf("[ \"file.txt\" ] 0x%x", g_char);
    }

    // Close "file.txt"
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("Failed to open \"file.txt\".");
}
```
